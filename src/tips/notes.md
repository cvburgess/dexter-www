# Notes

![Notes](/assets/tips/notes.png)

Notes are a space to jot down your thoughts and let your ideas flow.

## Using Notes

Notes live in the [Day](/tips/day) view under the **Notes** tab.

Most markdown syntax is supported so feel free to add links, headings, lists, and more.

## Settings

### Turning notes on and off

- **Enabled**: The notes tab will appear in the Day view
- **Disabled**: The notes tab will be hidden

### Customizing the daily notes template

Any markup you put in the **Daily Notes Template** section will act as a starting point that gets automatically "pasted" into each daily note.

If you like your notes to have certain headings, sections, or lists, using templates is an easy way to save yourself time every day.
