# Priorities

![Priorities](/assets/priorities-matrix.png)

Dexter uses a variation of the Eisenhower Matrix to make a clear distinction between the tasks that keep you busy and the tasks that move you closer to your goals. Busy != Productive.

If you want to go down the rabbit hole, here are some great resources about the Eisenhower Matrix:

## Unprioritized

By default, new tasks are not prioritized.

Take a moment to mindfully asses the two key questions:

1. Is this Important?
2. Is this Urgent?

Once all tasks have a priority this column will disappear from the board.

## Important

These tasks matter to you because they move you closer to your goals and dreams.

These are the things you'll look back on and be proud of or the building blocks to something you really want to achieve.

These aren't chores, errands, or busywork, they are things that make a difference and sometimes a little uncomfortable.

According to the only person I'm taking life advice from, Cher: [if it doesn't matter in five years, it doesn't matter](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGOTA8LpX3s/?hl=en).

## Urgent

These tasks are time sensitive - if you do not complete them soon, they are irrelevant.

If you can delegate or automate these tasks, great!

If not, consider time-boxing them or making them as won't do.

The "urgency trap" is when we constantly prioritize unimportant-but-urgent tasks over the things that really do matter to us. Be careful!

## Important & Urgent

Tasks in this column meet both the Important and Urgent criteria and should be completed before any other tasks.

These tasks will naturally bubble to the top of mosts lists in the app.

## Neither

These tasks should only be completed if you really *want to do them*, otherwise, consider letting them go like Marie Kondo.

Consider these your "rainy day" tasks.
