## Quick Planner

The quick planner is one of the most powerful Dexter features.

Look through all your tasks as you plan your week with easy access to filtering, grouping, and searching.

- Want to find all the tasks that you didn't finish last week? Easy.
- Want to find all the tasks remaining for that big project? Easy.
- Want to find all the tasks you've been saving for a rainy day? Easy.

The most relevant items automatically bubble to the top of the quick planner based on priority, due date, and status.
