# Tasks

![Task diagram](/assets/tips/tasks.png)

## Status

- **Todo**: Tasks you haven't seriously started
- **In Progress**: Tasks you have started and need to close out
- **Done**: Tasks you have completed
- **Won't Do**: Tasks you decided to close out without completing

Not everything needs to be completed. After planning your day, you may decide that a task is better off delegated or simply left undone so you can focus on something more important. **Won't do** is your super power in the battle against chronic busyness, don't be afraid to use it (wisely)!

## Priority

Because priority is such an important part of the [Dexter Method](/method) the main styling of task cards is derived from their priority.

## Due date vs do date

Dexter has two different types of dates: a due date, and the date a task is scheduled to be worked on (do date). Here's how they differ and why they are distinct.

- **Due Date**: US Taxes are Due April 15th
- **Do Date**: I might start my taxes in February once I have all my forms

In this scenario we can have one task due April 15th and start working on it sooner.

In the Dexter Day Planner, once you add a Due Date it will start ticking down the number of days you have left to complete the task. This can be very helpful when planning work thats further out and might sneak up on you.

## Lists

Lists are a simple, visual way to organize tasks any way you see fit.

Make a list for work, a list for chores, a list for hobbies, a list for projects - whatever makes sense in your brain.

Each list is represented by an emoji you choose to keep it kind of cute.

**Note**: Tasks can only be assigned to one list.

## More options

The more options menu is a catch all for buttons that didn't fit on the card. After all, there's only so much space.

- **Priority**: Assign a priority to the task (changes the card color)
- **Schedule**: Pick a day to work on the task (see "due date vs do date" above)
- **Repeat**: Schedule repeating tasks - daily, weekly, monthly, or annually
- **Delete**: Permanently deletes the task and all data associated with it
