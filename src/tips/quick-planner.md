# Quick Planner

![Quick Planner](/assets/tips/quick-planner.gif)

The quick planner is one of the most powerful Dexter features.

Look through all your tasks as you plan your day with easy access to filtering, grouping, and searching.

The most relevant items automatically bubble to the top of the quick planner based on priority, due date, and status.

## Filters

Dexter comes with a few filters out of the box to help you quickly find tasks that might be important for planning your day.

- **Overdue**: Tasks that had a due date and that date has come and gone (oops)
- **Due Soon**: Tasks that have a due date in the next few weeks
- **Left Behind**: Tasks that were scheduled in the past but not completed
- **Unscheduled**: Tasks that have not been scheduled

## Grouping

Grouping tasks allows you to pull in tasks by list, goal, priority etc.

Any grouping with no items in it will be lightly grayed out.

## Search

Remember a word in the task but no idea where you put it? Search can instantly find those tasks your subconscious tried hard to forget.
