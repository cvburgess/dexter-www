The calendar allows you to visualize meetings and time blocks while you plan your day.

Dexter allows you to add as many calendar feeds as you want, so feel free to add your work, personal, and even that astrology calendar, so you can see what the day has in store for you on every level.

## Using the Calendar

The calendar lives in the [Day](/tips/day) view.

Press the calendar icon in the toolbar to toggle it.
